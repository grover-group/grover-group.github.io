I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](/group), where we develop artificial intelligence  frameworks based on machine learning that can interact and reason with limited supervision. 
Specifically, my current research is on deep generative models and their intersection with sequential decision making and causal inference.
I am also an affiliate faculty at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA and lead the [ML4Climate](/ml4climate/about) initiative to develop data-driven solutions for climate change applications.


Before joining UCLA, I spent a gap year as a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR in Meta. Previously, I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. 
During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
