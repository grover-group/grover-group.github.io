I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the Machine Intelligence (MINT) group at UCLA, where we develop machine learning frameworks that can interact and reason with limited supervision. 
Specifically, our current research is on deep generative modeling and its intersection with sequential decision making under uncertainty and causal inference.
I am also an affiliate faculty in the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA, where we ground our foundations research in applications at the intersection of physical sciences and climate change.


Before joining UCLA, I spent a gap year as a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR in Meta. Previously, I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (2021; advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (2020; advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (2015; co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. 
During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
