I am fortunate to lead the the Machine Intelligence (MINT) group where I work with an amazing set of students and collaborators every day. 
We work on foundational topics relating to machine learning under limited supervision and sequential decision making, and ground our research in applications at the intersection of physical sciences and climate change.

## Ph.D.

* Tung Nguyen
* Hritik Bansal
* Daniel Israel
* Siyan Zhao

## Masters

* Satvik Mashkaria
* Siddarth Krishnamoorthy
* Meihua Dang

## Undergraduates

* Jason Jewik
* Baiting Zhu
* Bryan Tang
* Seongbin Park
* Siddharth Nandy

## Prospective Interns, Students, Postdocs

Thank you for your interest in joining my group. Please read the following information before applying:

* **Interns:** I host a few interns during the summer quarter every year (typically remote due to pandemic restrictions). Students should have completed prior coursework in machine learning and deep learning, have experience with machine learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch), and have read at least 2 of my previous papers. If you are interested, please email me your CV and the above information.  

* **Undergraduate and Graduate Students:** Due to the huge volume of mail, I will not be able to reply to individual mails from prospective students outside UCLA. I regularly take on students in my group at all levels. If you are interested, please apply directly to the appropriate program at UCLA and email me *after* you are admitted for available opportunities. UCLA students should have completed prior coursework in machine learning and deep learning, have experience with machine learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch), and have read at least 2 of my previous papers.

* **Postdocs:** I am looking to hire 1-2 postdocs in the coming year. Potential topics of interest include deep generative models, sequential decision making under uncertainty, and climate science. If you are interested, please email me your CV and list of 3 representative publications.
