Climate change is the defining challenge for the future of human civilization. For many decades, data-driven solutions have been a key component for understanding climate science, and efforts in mitigating and adapting to climate change. However, data science is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven in large by the development of modern machine learning systems that can play complex games, write stories, generate art, and much more.  What's in store for climate change research?

In the ML4Climate initiative led by Prof. Aditya Grover, we are pioneering the next generation of machine learning algorithms and frameworks that will inform the science, technology, and policy in mitigating and adapting to the changing climate. Our work broadly centers on 4 pillars at the intersection of artificial intelligence and climate change.

* **Research:** We regularly publish papers at the frontiers of artificial intelligence and climate change. Our current focus areas are in climate science and sustainable energy. 

* **Software:** We believe in open and reproducible science. Not just doing it, but enabling it. We develop and maintain datasets and software [benchmarks](https://climatelearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for pushing data-driven climate science.

* **Education:** We develop accessible courses and [tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114) to on board students, researchers, and practitioners with different backgrounds.

* **Community:** Our efforts are aimed at an interdisciplinary audience of researchers, policy makers, and concerned citizens. We write [perspectives](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climate-change-ai/papers/aaaifss2022/17/paper.pdf) and blog articles for broader audiences, and organize [events](https://ai4climatescience.github.io/) that engage diverse stakeholders.
